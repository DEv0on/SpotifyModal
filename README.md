# SpotifyModal
A bad WIP reimplementation of the spotify-modal Powercord coremod for the post-SWC era of Replugged, I think
  
# Install
  - [Download plugin ASAR file](https://github.com/Socketlike/SpotifyModal/releases/download/latest/lib.evelyn.SpotifyModal.asar)  
  - Move plugin ASAR file to Replugged plugin directory  
  - Reload Discord (if running)
  
# How to use
  - Play any Spotify song (that's literally it)
